# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: `this` is a neat little tool we add infront of keys when we want to call on them in the same object or constructor in a class!

  Researched answer: `this` is a function's keyword that refers to the object it belongs to when in the local scope.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a javascript library that combines javascript, html, and css into the ultimate front-end developer tool. You would use it for creating user-end expeirences for apps!

  Researched answer: React is a free and open sourse javascript library used for building user interfaces gifted to us by the almighty Facebook.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: To the best of my knowledge I believe render() is the required lifestyle method in react because it is in charge of rendering everything in the react component. 

  Researched answer: Oh snap it actually is render! Cool! So render is the required method in react lifecycles because it is the method that outputs the html elements to be displayed!



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is the flavorful combination of HTML and Javascript that ever so slightly alters the syntax of HTML and CSS whenever the languages use the same word for different functions. An example would be classes! Classes exist in both CSS and Javascript so inside of JSX we declare to CSS style classes with className.

  Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension of Javascript. This little guy allows us to write html within javascript code (Only in React though).



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: yarn is a package manager developed by facebook! It allows us to run programs like React and Jest. As far as modified files go when running yarn, I know for a fact it adds yarn.lock and package.json to your working directory.
<!-- The only yarn no one has to buy-->

  Researched answer: yarn is a newer package manager. Files affected by yarn are the node modules! Node modules contain a massive amount of files of code that honestly terrify me. Fun fact, node modules are ignored by git!
  



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I've never heard of an anonymous function before but my guess would be a function that doesn't have a name or a typical way to call it. It makes sense because when someone wants to remain anonymous they don't use their name!

  Researched answer: Anonymous functions are nameless functions that often are not accessible after its creation. They are typically used as arguments for other functions or functions that are immediately invoked for execution.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: React's equivelent of conditionals in javascript. Just like with javascript we can use if statements and conditional operators! woohoo!

2. Props: short for properties, props are very similar to objects or classes  as they allow us to pass information to a component. 

3. JavaScript Events: Events are actions to an HTML element with javascript functions

4. Object oriented programming: OOP is a style of programming that heavily utilizes classes and methods

5. Ruby: oh~ Ruby is a dynamic, open source, high-level programming language originally developed in Japan!
